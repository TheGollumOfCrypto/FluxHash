# FluxHash
FluxHash allows you to select the best algorithm to mine based on your hardware and will enable you to get paid in whatever currency you want.
It is built as an open-source project on top of [Flux](https://zel.network/flux).

## Why should you care?

Many blockchains rely on proof-of-work to secure the network. They often use ASIC-resistant algorithms to help with decentralization, as those algorithms can run on GPUs at most. GPUs are great! They allow miners to run various kinds of algorithms using the same hardware. Miners look for the most profitable coin based on their hardware, which changes dynamically based on multiple factors such as network complexity and coin prices.
To overcome this problem, miners often use services such as [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/), a service that selects the most profitable algorithm to mine based on the hardware and the demand of the hashing power and pays the miner in Bitcoin. There are several disadvantages to using such services:
- `Centralization`: Nicehash was hacked before, and while they paid everyone affected, there was a delay and a high level of uncertainty.
- `Fees`: The man-in-the-middle adds a 5% to 20% fee when selling you hashing power.
- `Payment currency`: Miners cannot select the currency to receive the payments.

## What is FluxHash

We believe that miners can make the most out of their hardware if we build tools that cut the man-in-the-middle and are decentralized, open source, and secure. Miners should always be in control of the mined rewards and must be able to select their prefered currency to get paid.

## How is it built?

FluxHash will use [Flux](https://zel.network/flux), a modern blockchain technology that allows running decentralized apps (dApps) in secured and scalable infraestructure, integrates with decentralized exchanges, and allows users to be in control over their private keys via the ZelCore app.
